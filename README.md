### Windows System Event Monitor and Alert Tool üö®üñ•Ô∏è

This Python script is designed to monitor specific Windows system events and alert you about any suspicious activity detected.

#### Key Features:
- **Customizable Event Monitoring**: Monitors a range of predefined system events, such as service installations, user actions, and security-related activities.
- **Real-time Alerting**: Displays pop-up alerts via `tkinter` messagebox when suspicious events are detected.
- **Easy Configuration**: Easily add or remove events to monitor by updating the `events` dictionary in the script.
- **Efficient Event Log Handling**: Utilizes `win32evtlog` to efficiently read and process Windows event logs.

#### Supported Events:
The script currently monitors events related to:
- Creation of Services
- User Account Management (creation, group addition, etc.)
- Security-related actions (firewall changes, Applocker events, etc.)
- USB Insertions
- File Access and Deletion
- Terminal Service Sessions
- Permission Changes
- Service Start/Stop Actions
- And more...

#### How to Use:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the script and necessary dependencies.
2. **Update Event Definitions**: Modify the `events` dictionary in the script to include or exclude specific event IDs you want to monitor.
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script to start monitoring Windows system events.
4. **Monitor Alerts**: Stay alert for pop-up messages indicating suspicious events detected by the tool.

#### Note:
- This tool is intended for educational and personal use to raise awareness about potential security threats on Windows systems.
- Customize the script according to your specific monitoring needs and integrate additional alerting mechanisms as required.
